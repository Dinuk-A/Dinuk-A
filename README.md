## QA Automation Engineer • Full-Stack Developer • AI Workflow Architect

I'm a software engineer who loves building robust applications AND making sure they actually work.

🏢 **By Day:** QA Automation Engineer  
→ Architecting enterprise test frameworks • Writing production Java code • Ensuring quality at scale

💻 **By Night:** Full-Stack Developer  
→ Building web apps with Spring Boot & React • Crafting RESTful APIs • Solving real problems

🤖 **Always:** AI Automation Explorer  
→ Creating intelligent workflows with LangGraph & N8N • Teaching systems to think and adapt

**Translation:** I code like a developer, test like a perfectionist, and automate like I've seen the future.  
Spoiler: It's awesome. 🚀
